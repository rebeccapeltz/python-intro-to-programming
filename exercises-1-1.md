# Exercises 1-1
This series of exercises will be your first taste of Python3. The activities are pretty straightforward, but please take the time to go through the exercises carefully. There will be a number of parts for each exercise. The parts in this description will correspond to the comments in the code. So instruction 1. will correspond to "# Question 1" in the code.

## Question 1:
We're going to start by assigning some simple values to variables.
 

* The first step is to assign your name tthe variable called name. Then use thprovided print statement to print the valuassigned to the variable. When you run thprogram, you should see your name printeto the console. 
* Now assign a value of the appropriate dattype to the variables my_string, my_intege and my_float.
* Finally, use the print function to printhe value of each of these three variablesYou should use one print function pevariable. Start printing on line 10.


## Question 2:
Of course variables are cool to store data, but programming gets even cooler because you can have the computer do operations for you. We're going to practice that first with a bit of arithmatic. Then with other operations.

* First, create two variables with the names of your choice. Remember, you cannot use reserved keywords as variable names. Then assign integer values to each of your two variables so that the two integers add up to 4.
* Please write code that assigns the sum of your two variables' values to a variable called first_sum on line 18.
* Now let's multiply the first sum variable by 10 and reassign it to a variable named multiplied_sum.
* Last, let's add 2 to multiplied_sum and assign it to a variable called secret and print that variable to the console.


Computers were originally invented to as calculation machines. They were used to run calculations much more rapidly than humans could do. You've just used your computer as a calculating machine interacting with it using the Python programming language.

## Question 3:
Now we're moving on to work with strings. For now, you can think of strings as series of characters. A word is a string ("I am a string"). A number can also be a string ("42"). Strings are identified in Python with quotation marks. Python doesn't care if you surround your string with "double" quotes or 'single' quotes, as long as you are consistent. Just out of habit, I use double quotes for literal strings that will be printed, and single quotes for dictionary keys and such (you'll learn about that later), so it's best to be in the habit of using double quotes for strings.

To start, you want to add a last name here.

* Add your last name to the value held in the variable assigned on line 2 and make sure there's a space between your first and last name. Reassign that new value to the variable full_name.
* You just did string addition. Now we can use some built in functions to manipulate the string. On lines 43-46, using the name variable and the appropriate functions, assign the appropriate values to the variables all_caps, all_lowercase, first_five_letters, and last_two_letters. We've done the first for you as an example. (https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)
* Finally, print each of these variables to the console, each on a new line.
